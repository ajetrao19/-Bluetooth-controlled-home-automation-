#Description - 
 The project aims to control various home appliances, such as lights and fans, wirelessly through Bluetooth communication. However, since Tinkercad does not directly support Bluetooth modules like HC-05 or HC-06, serial communication is used as a substitute. In a real-world scenario, Bluetooth modules would be used to establish a wireless connection between an Arduino board and a smartphone.
In this simulation, the Arduino Uno board is programmed to receive commands via the serial monitor in Tinkercad. These commands are used to turn on or off different appliances connected to the circuit. A motor is used to represent a fan, while a bulb represents a standard home lighting system. The use of a transistor and a 1kΩ resistor allows us to control high-power loads effectively.

Components Used-
1. Arduino Uno – The microcontroller used to control the appliances based on received commands.
2. Motor – Represents a fan in the home automation system.
3. Bulb – Represents a lighting system.
4. Transistor (NPN) – Acts as a switch to control the motor and bulb.
5. 1kΩ Resistor – Protects the transistor and limits current flow.
6. Serial Monitor – Used in place of Bluetooth communication in Tinkercad.
